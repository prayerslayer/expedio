# exped.io

Trying to build an opinionated, but fast and pretty frontend for Expedia.

# Goals

1. Fast - Expedia is slow. Achieve this with slim templates and intelligent resource fetching.
2. Pretty - Expedia is ugly and cluttered. Achieve this with proper space between text and big images.
3. Usable - Expedia provides too many options I don't need. Remove them.
